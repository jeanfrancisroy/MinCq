MinCq is a Machine Learning algorithm published at ICML 2011 conference.

Please read the extended version of the paper available at http://graal.ift.ulaval.ca/publications.php for more information about the theory involved and the description of the algorithm and hyperparameters.

This code provides a simplified version of the algorithm that you may use to test it out. Please contact me if you have any questions or requests. As an example, I can help you adding your favorite kernel function into my code, etc.

A collection of "usual" UCI and MNIST datasets are available on my website.
